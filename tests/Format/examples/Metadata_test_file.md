# Metadata test file - includes data in IIM, XMP, and Exif.jpg
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metadata_test_file_-_includes_data_in_IIM,_XMP,_and_Exif.jpg

This is a metadata test file. It has values in all of the relevant IPTC fields, including many extended fields, in both the IIM and XMP data blocks. In addition, it contains Exif data as would be written by a mobile phone, Including sample GPS data and values in the three Exif fields that have IPTC equivalents.
NOTE that this file is out-of-sync. The Caption/description, Creator and Copyright fields have different values in the IIM, XMP, and Exif data blocks. Thus, this file has some utility in determining an application's metadata reading behavior. ("Some utility" means just that. It is not authoritative.)

This file also contains some Photoshop log information, Lightroom Develop information, and a thumbnail. This file is not representative of any file you are likely to encounter in the real world. Any copy of it you find floating loose on the internet is very likely to be corrupted. The original file can be found at www.carlseibert.com/commons

The timestamp is only as accurate as the clock in the camera, and it may be completely wrong.
